-Because i can't use Sass or Less iv chose to make some global classes in my style.css. iv made for H elements, font, button max width for my fixed with and a class that fixes my fixed position on the top navbar. i also chose to not make to many global classes as it easy can make confusion. if i made one for display:flex and center-align my css would prabably be alot more dry, but i chose not to. the thing is that i have thought about it, and i would never do that if i could use Sass or Less. 
-I have used root to maintain my website in the future, when i have more time i will most likly change stuff and use it in my portfolio. that would be alot easier with the root. 
- the only AI i used midjourney for images only.
- i chose not to us UL and LI in my section for expalem special events
-i chose to set font color to all text, so i know its the right color regardless of web browser
-embed map code on visit us site is copyed from google maps, and it had inline styling by default. 
- i used my time to take marking criteria into consideration. so i have no fancy keyframes. i hope this not effect my grade, as it didn't say anything in the marking criteria.  
-i decided to add icons on my events bcs,they have contextual meaning, and the icons will probably be changed alot if you think about that it is special events. 
- i removed my background image on explore site on 1189px as it looked confusing on smaller screen size(most desktops are over 1180px anyway)
